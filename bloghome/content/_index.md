## what am i looking at

this is a custom [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) [blog theme](https://github.com/candacelabs/blog) based on
the [candaceserver home page](https://candace.cloud/) terminal aesthetic. that page is just pure HTML. but for a blog,
i would instead like to be able to write and store my content in Markdown. but i really liked the simplistic theme
so i decided to create my own Hugo template for it. the source for this this page itself can be found at a
[fork](https://github.com/candacelabs/blog-candace-main/tree/main) of the original main [blog](https://github.com/candacelabs/blog)
template

### how does this work?

the homepage mimics the terminal style from the main candaceserver page, while individual posts use the clean app-style interface like the pastebin and 007 services.

### available features

- terminal-style homepage with green headings and cyan links
- clean app-style post layouts
- responsive design
- ping service color scheme and typography
- back-to-terminal navigation

try clicking on a post to see the clean interface, then come back here for the terminal vibes!
