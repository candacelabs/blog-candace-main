this is a test post to demonstrate the clean app-style interface inspired by the candaceserver ping service.

## features demonstrated

this post layout includes:

- clean typography matching the pastebin/007 interfaces
- professional blue color scheme (#002a5c, #004085)
- rounded containers with subtle shadows
- monospace code blocks
- back-to-terminal navigation

```bash
# example code block with ping service styling
curl https://candace.cloud/ping
# returns: "ive been visited X times"
```

notice how this feels different from the terminal homepage but maintains the same underlying aesthetic philosophy.

<div class="info">
this is an info box styled like the ping service apps
</div>

<div class="warning">
⚠️ this is a warning box like in the 007 secret service
</div>
