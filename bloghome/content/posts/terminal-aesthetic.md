the candaceserver homepage has this amazing raw terminal feel that's both nostalgic and modern.

## design elements

### color palette
- dark background (#111) creates that terminal window feel
- bright green headings (#0f0) for that classic hacker vibe  
- cyan links (#0ff) that shift to magenta when visited
- yellow on hover (#ff0) for that authentic terminal response

### typography
monospace fonts throughout create consistency with actual terminal output.

### tone
the casual, lowercase writing style ("welcome to candaceserver", "ive been visited X times") feels personal and approachable while maintaining the technical aesthetic.

## dual personality

what's brilliant about the ping service is how it transitions from the raw terminal homepage to polished app interfaces:

- **homepage**: raw, personal, terminal
- **apps**: clean, professional, modern

this theme tries to capture that same duality.
